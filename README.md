# fcc-d3-bar-chart

I was taught about the `Title` D3 Attribute, but At least the way I was implementing it the tests weren't working out. So I added a `Text` atribute to replicate the tooltip.

Biggest takeaway was the `.on()` specifically `on.(mouseover)`, `on.(mousemove)`, and `on.(mouseout)`.

Smaller takeaway was rotating text. the translations of rotated text kind of threw me through a loop.
